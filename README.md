# OUTLIER-AIRLINE-ANALYSIS

OUTLIER AIRLINES has been providing high-quality air transportation services to the clients for several years, and their primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable, and a convenient journey for our passengers. 
However, the winds of change are upon them. The aviation industry, as many of us are aware, is currently navigating a complex landscape. They are facing increasing pressures from stricter environmental regulations, higher operational costs due to rising taxes and fuel prices, and a competitive labor market. These factors are undeniably impacting their profitability.
Furthermore, the experience of air travel for many has become increasingly challenging. Recent headlines and countless personal accounts highlight a growing frustration among passengers due to widespread flight delays, disruptions, and, regrettably, instances of unsatisfactory service and staff behavior across the industry. This turbulence in the skies and on the ground is impacting passenger trust and loyalty.

But within these challenges lies a significant opportunity for OUTLIER AIRLINES.  By leveraging the power of their own data, they can not only identify and address the internal factors affecting the profitability, such as optimizing flight occupancy and resource allocation, but also understand the evolving needs and frustrations of today's traveller and provide them a seamless and satisfying experience.



**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium-sized machines. We have been providing high-quality air transportation services to our clients for several years, and our primary focus is to ensure a safe, comfortable, and a convenient journey for our passengers. However, we are currently facing challenges due to several factors such as stricter environmental regulations, higher flight taxes, increased interest rates, rising fuel prices, and a tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs. As a result, the company's profitability is under pressure, and they are seeking ways to address this issue. To tackle this challenge, they are looking to conduct an analysis of their database to find ways to increase their occupancy rate, which can help boost the average profit earned per seat.



**MAJOR CHALLENGES:**

1. Stricter environmental regulations: The demand on the airlines industry to decrease its carbon footprint is growing, which has resulted in more stringent environmental laws that raise operating costs and restrict expansion potential.
2. Higher flight taxes: To solve environmental issues and increase revenue, governments all around the world are taxing aircrafts heavily, which in turn raises the cost of flying and eventually decreases the demand.
3. Tight labor market resulting in increased labor costs: The lack of trained people in the aviation sector has increased labor costs.



**OBJECTIVES:**

1. Increase occupancy rate: By increasing the occupancy rate, we can boost the average profit earned per seat and mitigate the impact of the challenges we are facing
2. Improve the price strategy: We need to develop a pricing strategy that takes into account the changing market conditions and customer preferences to attract and retain customers.
3. Enhance customer experience: We need to focus on providing a seamless and convenient experience for our customers, from booking to arrival, to differentiate ourselves in a highly 
competitive industry and increase customer loyalty.
